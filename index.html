INTRO

"It was a dark and stormy night..."

"What was so stormy about it?"

"The passionate kiss!"

"What?!"

I started to wonder if I should try to make her feel jealous?
She'd totally deserve it after last Thursday...
Then again, maybe I should try to smooth things over.

- I think we may be in love! [THE FIGHT]
- It wasn't JUST a kiss! [THE FIGHT]
- It was nothing. [THE INTERROGATION]
- Just kidding! There was no kiss. [HAPPY ENDING]

THE FIGHT

"How DARE you! I thought we were meant to be?"

She left me. GAME OVER.

- Restart [INTRO]

THE INTERROGATION

"What EXACTLY do you mean by that?"

I could see from her eyes she meant business.
It was time for me to tell her the truth.

- I love you, and only you. [HAPPY ENDING]
- I kiss other people all the time! [THE FIGHT]

HAPPY ENDING

"Oh, you rascal!"

"No, seriously, you are the only one for me. Never worry."

"I'm so lucky!"

We lived happily every after. THE END.

- Restart [INTRO]
