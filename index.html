MUSHROOM CIRCLE
[wildmushroomcircle.png]
[1st][get 5 gold]
[1st]Drops of morning dew glint in the light of a rising sun. You are outdoors, standing in the middle of a mushroom circle. 

All around you are fresh mushrooms, the air smells sweet, and in the distance looms a huge walled fortress. You are cold, damp, and very lost.

To your left stands a huge stone watchtower, and up ahead you see a stone path leading to the fortress.

An old backpack is strapped to your back, but it feels empty.

BACKPACK
[1st] You remove your trusty canvas backpack and take stock of your current inventory.
[roll = 1d4]
[roll==1] You are holding

[1st][get mushroom]You decide to pick one of the mushrooms for later use.
[else][get mushroom]You decide to pick another.
You now have [mushroom] mushroom[s].

STONE TOWER
[wildtowerdoor.png]
Gazing up, you notice that this is a belltower, perhaps used as a lookout post. Standing outside the fortress walls, 
from the top you could see beyond the mountains. The door is locked. 

[has key] You decide to use the silver key to unlock the belltower door.
[else] You decide to look for a key in one of the buildings up ahead.

STONE PATH
[wildpathtobridge.png]
The path is made of rough-cut stone, looks anicient, and leads to a drawbridge.
To the left of the path are giant natural hot springs, bubbling quietly.

In the distance you can see a crooked tower.
By your feet are some unusual yellow flowers, still closed after a chilly night.

YELLOW FLOWERS
[1st][get flower]The flowers glisten with nectar and shine like honey. You take one.
[else] One of the lowers has already been picked, and you decide to leave the others to grow free.

HOT SPRINGS
[wildhotsprings.png]
The water in the springs is boiling hot, smells faintly of sulfur, and radiates a comforting warmth.
You can see the stone tower behind you, just down the stone path, and the crooked tower up ahead.
To your right is a fortress wall protected by a moat with a drawbridge.

DRAWBRIDGE
[maplebridgetocastle.png]
The drawbridge is down, and before you stands the grand entrance to a huge fortress made of stone.
You can see ornate gardens beyond the fortress gates, and behind you is a stone path.

FORTRESS GATES
[maplecastlegates.png]
Beyond the fortress entrance lies a beautiful, lush garden. A waterfall cascades down a rock island,
upon which a majestic knarled maple tree grows. It looks a thousand years old, and has tiny red leaves the colour of rust.

LUSH GARDEN
[maplegemgarden.png]
You are standing in a beautiful garden, simple and clean. It seems timeless, like the season is always summer here.
To your right is a glowing cluster of crystals by a small bridge, and on the right are some houses.

CRYSTALS
[maplegemcluster.png]
In a corner of the garden grows a shimmering cluster of giant crystals.
[has chisel] You could collect a shard with your chisel.
[else] You decide to look for some sort of tool that would alow you to collect one.
To your left is a small bridge that leads to the upper fortress, and behind you are the fortress gates and their lush garden.

COLLECT A SHARD
[1st] [get shard] You strike the crystal with your chisel and in a flash of sparks a shard chips off. You put it into your bakpack for safe keeping.
[else] These crystals have already been harvested, and a shard is in your bakpack.

SOME HOUSES
[maplecastlepath.png]
Beyond the lush garden is another bridge leading to what look like houses or administrative buildings.
Tucked behind them, in a back yard, is a stone monument. To your left is a stairway leading to an upper courtyard.

UPPER PILLARS
[maplecastlepillars.png]
At the topmost level of the fortress is a grand roofed entrance, with massive marble columns and a grand maplewood door.
Below you is a courtyard with paths leading in all directions.
On your left is an ancient tree so overgrown you just might be able to climb it.

STONE MONUMENT
[maplemonolith.png]
An ancient marble monument, covered in carved symbols in a language you cannot read, stands resolutely behind some houses.

COURTYARD
[maplepathtostonehenge.png]
A stone path splits four ways in the middle of a central courtyard.

Behind you are stairs leading to a small bridge.
To your right are some houses, part of the lower fortress garden district.

Up ahead, surrounded by flowers and trees, stands a circle of stone monoliths.
There is also a set of stairs here that lead to the upper fortress pillars.

SMALL BRIDGE
[maplestairstostonehenge.png]
The inner courtyard of the fortress is just over the small bridge by the lush garden.
A plain wooden bench sits here, offering respite for weary travellers.
Beyond the trees the path continues up a set of steep stairs to upper courtyard.

STONE MONOLITHS
[maplestonehenge.png]
At the far end of the upper courtyard stands a henge of stones, arranged in a circle.
In the center is a rock with a hole harved into it that surely faces into the sunrise on just the right day.
